Solve for x in the equation: x^2 + 4x - 12 = 0,"Base model response: 'To solve for x, we can use the quadratic formula:

So, the solutions to the equation are x = 2 and x = -6.'

Evaluated model response: 'To solve the quadratic equation x^2 + 4x - 12 = 0, we can use factoring or the quadratic formula.

Method 1: Factoring

We need to find two numbers whose product is -12 and whose sum is 4. These numbers are 6 and -2, since 6 * (-2) = -12 and 6 + (-2) = 4.

x^2 + 4x - 12 = (x + 6)(x - 2) = 0

This tells us that either (x + 6) = 0 or (x - 2) = 0.

Solving for x, we get:

x + 6 = 0 --> x = -6

x - 2 = 0 --> x = 2

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = -6 and x = 2.

Method 2: Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula is:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = 4, and c = -12.

x = (-(4) ± √((4)^2 - 4(1)(-12))) / 2(1)
x = (-4 ± √(16 + 48)) / 2
x = (-4 ± √64) / 2
x = (-4 ± 8) / 2

Simplifying, we get:

x = (-4 + 8) / 2 = 4/2 = 2

x = (-4 - 8) / 2 = -12/2 = -6

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = -6 and x = 2, which match the results from the factoring method.'"
