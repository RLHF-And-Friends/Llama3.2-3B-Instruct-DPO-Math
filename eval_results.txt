  - ✅ preference (GEval) (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: local model, reason: The actual output correctly solves for x and follows the expected requirements outlined in the input request, context, and math facts., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 15
  - actual output: To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x.

Given equation: 2x + 5 = 15

Subtract 5 from both sides:

  - input: Solve the system of equations: x + y = 10 and 2x - y = 3
  - actual output: To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

Given equations:
1) x + y = 10
2) 2x - y = 3

We can add the two equations to eliminate the variable 'y':

(x + y) + (2x - y) = 10 + 3
Combine like terms:
3x = 13

Now, divide by 3:
x = 13/3
x = 4.33 (approximately)

Now that we have the value of 'x', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of 'y'. Let's use the first equation:
x + y = 10
4.33 + y = 10

Subtract 4.33 from both sides:
y = 10 - 4.33

For test case:

  - input: Solve the equation for y: y^2 - 4 = 0
  - actual output: To solve the equation y^2 - 4 = 0, we can start by adding 4 to both sides:

y^2 = 4

Next, we can take the square root of both sides:

y = ±√4

Since √4 = 2, we have:

y = ±2

For test case:

  - input: What is the solution to 3x^2 + 12x = 0?
  - actual output: To solve the equation 3x^2 + 12x = 0, we can start by factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF) of 3x:

3x(x + 4) = 0

Now, we can apply the zero-product property, which states that if the product of two factors is equal to zero, then at least one of the factors must be equal to zero.

So, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:

3x = 0 --> x = 0

x + 4 = 0 --> x = -4

Therefore, the solutions to the equation 3x^2 + 12x = 0 are x = 0 and x = -4.

First, subtract 2x from both sides:

4x - 2x + 10 = 2x - 2x + 16
2x + 10 = 16

For test case:

  - input: Solve the system of equations: 2x + 3y = 12 and x - y = 2
  - actual output: To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we have the two equations:

1) 2x + 3y = 12
2) x - y = 2

We can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations the same:

2) 2x - 2y = 4

Now we have:

1) 2x + 3y = 12
2) 2x - 2y = 4

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:

(2x + 3y) - (2x - 2y) = 12 - 4
3y + 2y = 8
5y = 8

Now, divide both sides by 5:

y = 8/5
y = 1.6

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of x. Let's use the second equation:

x - y = 2
x - 1.6 = 2
x = 2 + 1.6
x = 3.6

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is x = 3.6 and y = 1.6.
